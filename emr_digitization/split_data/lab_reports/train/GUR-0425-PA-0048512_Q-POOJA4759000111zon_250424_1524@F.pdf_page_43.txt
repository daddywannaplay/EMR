Comments
This test is uped to check for the presence of a systemic infection when the patient shows signs or symptoms of a bacterial
infection, sugh as fever, chills, elevated white blood cell count, and fatigue. which also may be a sign of infection occurring in
other parts of the body, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, diarrhea, or skin infection
A positive bigod culture may mean that patient is having 4 bacterial or funga! mfection in your bloodstream that needs to be
treated immé@diately or it could be false positive due to skin contamination. A positive result could also be a faise positive
caused by sin contamination. So a repeat blood culture test positive with the same bacteria, indicates that the Dactena
found in the gulture are causing infection
A negative chlture test indicates the absence of any infection , or patient is on antibiotics or some microorganisms are more
difficult to gr@w in culture and more testing may be required. A clinical correiation of the test result is very important
