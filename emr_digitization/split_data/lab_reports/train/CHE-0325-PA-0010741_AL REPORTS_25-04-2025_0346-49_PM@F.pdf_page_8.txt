BILIRUBIN TOTAL, Serum 11.80 mg/dL Adult 0.2 - 1.2
Method- Azobilirubin, Diphylline
BILIRUBIN DIRECT, Serum 0.90 mg/dL upto 0.3
Method : End-point Colorimetric (Dual wavelength)
BILIRUBIN INDIRECT,Serum 10.90 mg/dL 0.2-1.0
Method : End-point Colorimetric (Dual wavelength)
Remark :
Disclaimer :
On Vitros Dry chemistry as per the method instructions ,since Total , Direct and Indirect bilirubin are measured independently it can mean
that sum of direct bilirubin and Indirect bilirubin may not be exactly equal to Total bilirubin result. The normally expected variability in the
independent measurements of Tbil, BU( Indirect), BC( Direct) will occasionally produce a sum of BU+BC that may be slightly greater or
slightly less than (upto +/-0.3mg/dl) the TBII, even when the true concentrations of Bu+Bc and tbil are identical. Conjugated Bilirubin in
plasma reacts to form the bilirubin-albumin conjugate called as delta bilirubin. Delta bilirubin remains elevated for longer duration. Delta
bilirubin remains elevated long after biliary obstruction is cleared. Kindly correlate clinically.
