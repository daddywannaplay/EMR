Interpretation 1. PCT is the prohormone of calcitonin secreted
by different types of cells from numerous
organs in response to proinflammatory
stimulation, particularly bacterial stimulation.
2. Depending upon clinical background, PCT >
0.1 can indicate clinically relevant bacterial
infection, requiring antibiotic treatment.
3. PCT is an important marker enabling specific
differentiation between bacterial infection and
other causes of inflammatory
reactions
4. Resorption of septic infection is accompanied
by decreases in PCT concentration which
returns to normal with half life of 24 hours
5. In certain situations (newborns, polytrauma,
burns,major surgery, prolonged or severe
cardiogenic shock etc) PCT elevation may
be independent of any infectious aggression.
The return to normal values is usually rapid
6. Viral infections, allergies, autoimmune
diseases and graft rejection do not lead to
significant increase in PCT. Localized bacterial
infections can lead to moderate increase in PCT
levels.
NOTE. Patients on Biotin supplement may have
interference in some immunoassays. With
individuals taking high dose Biotin (more than
5
mg per day) supplements, at least 8-hour wait
time before blood draw is recommended.
Low Risk for Sepsis : < 0.5 ng/ml.
High Risk for Sepsis : > 2.0 ng/ml.
