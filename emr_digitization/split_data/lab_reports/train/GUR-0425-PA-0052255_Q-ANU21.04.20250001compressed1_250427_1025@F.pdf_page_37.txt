HB A1C 5.20 %
EXPECTED VALUES :-
Metabolicaly healthy patients = 4.8-6.0 % HbAIC
Good Control = 6.0-6.8 % HbAIC
Fair Control = 6.8-8.2 % HbAIC .
Poor Control = >8.2 % HbAIC
REMARKS:-
in vitro quantitative determination of HbAIC in whole blood is utilized in long term monitoring of glycemia .
rhe HbAIC level correlates with the mean glucose concentration prevailing in the course of the patient's
recent history (approx - 6-8 weeks) and therefore provides much more reliable information for glycemia
monitoring than do determinations of blood glucose or urinary glucose
it ig recommended that the determination of HbAIC be performed at intervals of 4-6 weeksduring Diabetes
Mellitus therapy
iesults of HbAIC should be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical
examinations
and other findings
