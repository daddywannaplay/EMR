Methodology iguid
Use :
1.Monitoring compliance and long-term blood glucose level control in patients with diabetes
2.Index of diabetic control (direct relationship between poor control and development
of complications).
3. Predicting development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications.
Limitations :
1. AlC values may be falsely elevated or decreased in those with chronic kidney disease.
2.False elevations may be due in part to analytical interference from carbamylated hemoglobin
formed in the presence of elevated concentrations of urea, with some assays.
3. False decreases in measured AIC may occur with hemodialysis and altered red cell turnover,
especially in the setting of erythropoietin treatment
