BIOCHEMISTRY
ProCalcitonin 0.5 ng/mL <0.5 ng/mL
Comment:
Procalcitonin, the prohormone of calcitonin is below limit of detection (0.25 ng/ml) in healthy individuals. It rises in
response to an inflammatory stimulus especially of bacterial origin. It does not rise significantly with viral or non
infectious inflammations.
Procalcitonin level Inferences
< 0.25 ng/mL Minor local bacterial infection is possible. Severe systemic Infection
(sepsis) is not likely
0.25 - < 2 ng/mL Systemic infection is possible, but various conditions are known to
induce PCT as well (see below). Suggest repeat after 6-24 hours for a
definitive diagnosis
2.0 - <10 ng/mL Systemic infection (sepsis) is likely, unless other causes are known
>10 ng/mL Important systemic inflammatory response, almost exclusively due to
severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
PCT levels can be elevated in non infectious causes like:
“The first days after a major trauma, major surgical intervention, burns, treatment with OKT3 antibodies and other |
drugs stimulating the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, small cell lung cancer, medullary C-cell carcinoma of thyroid.
*Patients with prolonged or severe cardiogenic shock, prolonged severe organ perfusion anomalies.
* Neonates < 48 hrs of life.
*Patients with PCT values <2 ng/ml should be closely monitored both clinically and by reassessing PCT within 6-24
hrs.
