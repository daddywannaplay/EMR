TEST RESULTS UNIT BIOLOGICAL REF RANGE TEST REMARK
Anti HAV IgM
Anti HAV IgM,Serum Reactive S/CO Nonreactive
Anti HAV IgM OD Value H 11.83 Ss/CO <0.8 : Non Reactive
CMIA 0.8 - 1.2 : Grayzone
>=1.2 : Reactive
Note:
1. Patients exhibiting Grayzone Reactivity should be monitored at weekly intervals.
This will distinguish rising Anti HAVIgM levels associated with Acute Hepatitis A infection
from decreasing or unchanging levels often associated with recovery.
2. Reactive results suggest recent HAV infection.
3. Rheumatoid factor can give rise to false positive results.
4. False negative / positive results are observed in patients receiving mouse
monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy.
5. For heparinized patients, draw specimen prior to heparin therapy as presence of
fibrin leads to erroneous results.
Comments :
Hepatitis A Virus ( HAV) is a RNA virus of Picornavirus family transmitted by fecal- oral
route. Infection with HAV is self limiting though 5-10% cases may show a secondary rise
in enzymes. Since symptomatic Hepatitis A virus infections are clinically indistinguishable
from Hepatitis B or C virus, serological testing is an extremely important tool to achieve
proper diagnosis. During the acute phase of HAV infection, IgM appears in patients
serum in nearly all cases at the onset of symptoms, peaks within the first month of
illness and persists for 3-6 months. It declines to undetectable levels within 12 months.
The most effective diagnostic determination of HAV acute infection is the detection of
Anti HAV- IgM.
