NS-1 ANTIGEN DENGUE
Immunochromatography
RESULT NON - REACTIVE
REMARKS:
In tropical and subtropical regions, dengue is the most important arbovirosis in terms of mortality and morality.
An easy-to-perform, rapid and specific test is needed to confirm infection during the acute phase of the
infection
in order to implement appropriate treatment during early course of teh disease. NS1 antigen is an non-
structural protein recognized as a marker of acute phase of dengue infection, a period for which traditional
serological antibodies based methods are of limited value. NS1 antigen was found circulating in sample of
“ infected patients
from the first day up to 9 days after onset of fever (1,2 & 3) .
Dengue NS1 Aq Strip is an individual test for qualitative detection of Dengue virus NS1 antigen
in human serum or plasma as an aid in the diagnosis of acute dengue infection.
