the RBC, W8C, Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, PCV, MPV and Platelet parameters for venous anticoagulated whole blood
which are collectively called as complete blood counts.CBP is a screening tool which helps in the diagnosis of a
variety of conditions and diseases such as anemia, feukemia, bleeding disorders, and infections. This test is also
