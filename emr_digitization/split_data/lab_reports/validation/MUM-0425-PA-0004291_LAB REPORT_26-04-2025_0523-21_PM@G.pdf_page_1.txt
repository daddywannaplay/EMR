eGFR which is primarily based on Serum Creatinine is a derivation of CKD-
EPI 2009
equation normalized tol.73 sq.m BSA and is not applicable to individuals below 18 years.
eGFR tends to be less accurate when Serum Creatinine estimation is indeterminate e.g.
patients at extremes of muscle mass, on unusual diets etc. and samples with severe Hemolysis
Icterus / Lipemia.
