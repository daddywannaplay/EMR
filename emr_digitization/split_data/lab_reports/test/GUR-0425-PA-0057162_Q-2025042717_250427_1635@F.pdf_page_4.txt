(Enhanced chemiluminiscence)
Comments : Assay precision </= 10 % total CV
- Limitations of the procedure:-
Heterophile antibodies in human serum can react with
immunoassys. patients routinely exposed to animals or to products can be prone to this
interference
and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be reuired for diagnosis.
PARATHYROID HORMONE 115.00 15 - 65 pg/ml
(PTH) _——
(Enhanced chemiluminiscence)
Comments : Parathyroid hormone (PTH)is a single chain 84 amino acid polypeptide produced by the parathyroid gland. After
PTH is secreted into the blood stream it undergoes extensive proteolysis to generate various fragments. In
contrast to its degradation products, the concentration of Intact PTH is relatively independent of glomerular
filtration rate and refelcts the biologically active portion of the hormone.
Guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry recommend the use of intraoperative parathyroid
hormone testing for patients during surgery for hyperparathyroidism, especially in minimally invasive or directed
procedures, as well as for patients undergoing reoperation. For pateints undergoing parathyroidectomy it is
recommended that preoperative and pre-excision samples are taken. Samptes should also be drawn at 5 and 10
minutes post resection and a >50% reduction in PTH levels from the highest baseline may be used as criteria for
surgical success.
Test results should be interpreted in conjunction with serum calcium and phophorus levels and clinical finding.
As per KDIGO guidelines, the PTH concentration of patients treated by dialysis should be maintained within two
to nine times the upper normal limit of the assay (VIDAS PTH interval in such patient is 89.2 — 401.4 pg/ml).
