Interpretation: Prothrombin time measures the extrinsic coagulation pathway which consists of activated Factor Vil
(Vila), tissue factor and proteins of the common pathway (Factors X, V, Il & Fibrinogen).Prolonged PTAdministration
of oral anticoagulant drugs Liver disease, particularly obstructive jaundice Vitamin K deficiency Disseminated
intravascular coagulation Inherited deficiency of factors in extrinsic pathway (VI) and common pathway (V, x,
prothrombin and fibrinogen}intemational Normalized Ratio ‘endash Is used for defining the therapeutic ranges for
anticoagulant therapy. Appropriate therapeutic range varies with the disease and treatment intensity. Recommended
Therapeutic range for Oral Anticoagulant therapy INR 2.0-3.5: Treatment of Venous thrombosis & Pulmonary
embolism, Prophylaxis of Venous thrombosis (High risk surgery), Prevention of systemic embolism in tissue heart
valves, AMI, Valvular heart disease & Atrial fibrillation, Bileaflet mechanical vaive in aortic position
Note: 7. Results should be clinically correlated

(PTT / APTT) measures the activity of intrinsic and common pathway of coagulation, which consists of Factor Xi,
Prekallikrein, High molecular i ininogen, Factors Vill, IX & Xt. It also measures proteins of the common
pathway
