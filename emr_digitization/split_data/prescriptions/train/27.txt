Dear Mansur,

As-salaamu aleikum.

Just finished a morning's work at the Khankah office in Newark, where I now work every Friday morning. Now I am at dialysis in Greenville (pardon the stationery).

We are drafting final statements on a number of subjects for the organizational issue of Bismillah due out in a month or so, inshallah.

I went into the Khankah Chapel to practice Tassawuri Murshid, as a preparation for writing a statement on the “Silsila Safina”. How surprised I was when it was your being I attuned to instead of Murshid’s per se!

The entire heartfelt & yearning spirit of worship to Murshid came through with such beauty & force of feeling that I accepted it without question as a direct transmission from the sphere.

It helped me considerably to finalize the statement at hand.

Alhamdulillah!
Moinuddin
