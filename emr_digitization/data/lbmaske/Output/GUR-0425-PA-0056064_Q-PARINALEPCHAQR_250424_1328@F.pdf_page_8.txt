Method : Slide Agglutination.
Interpretation of the test results:-
An absolute agglutination titre of = 1:80 for TO and /or = 1:760 for TH/ AH/ BH is-n6rmally considered significant. A rising titre
in case of a test repeated after few days is also significant and suggestive Of enteric fever. In enteric fever, antibodies usually
appear in patient's blood after 6th day of fever. Sera for normal individuals may agglutinate these antigens in dilutions up to
1:80. In individuals who have received TAB vaccine, moderate rise in H antibodies may be seen. |
Interpretation of Widal test must be seen in light of clinical picture.
This test measures somatic O and flagellar H antibodies against Typhoid and Paratyphoid bacilli. The
agglutinins usually appear at the end of the first week of infection and increase steadily till third / fourth week after which the
decline starts, A positive Widal test may occur because of typhoid vaccination or pi M i i
autoimmune diseases. Non specific febrile disease may cause this titre to i
falsely negative in cases of Enteric fever treated with antibiotics in the early|
week after infection is Blood Culture,
