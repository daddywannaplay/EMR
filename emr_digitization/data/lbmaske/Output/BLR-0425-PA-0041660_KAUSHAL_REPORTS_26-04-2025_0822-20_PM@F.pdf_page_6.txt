Blood - ESR cy mm/hr 1-14
(Infrared detection based on Modified Westergren’s)

Principle: Automated ESR measures the erythrocytes kinetics aggregation in agglomerin presence.
Red cell aggregation by kinetic capillary photometry .
Note: Capillary photometry technology overcomes the variables and limitations of sedimentation method.
Interpretation:
1. It indicates presence and intensity of an inflammatory process, never diagnostic of a specific disease. Changes are
more significant than a single abnormal test.

T It is a prognostic test and used to monitor the course or response to treatment of diseases like tuberculosis, bacterial
