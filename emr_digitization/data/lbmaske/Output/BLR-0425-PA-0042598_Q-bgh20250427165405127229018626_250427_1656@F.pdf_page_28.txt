AFB / ZN STAIN ROUTINE
Sample PLEURAL FLUID
Result No AFB seen in the given sample.
Remark :

* ZN stain provides only presumptive diagnosis of Mycobacterial disease; TB culture is regarded as gold standard for diagnosis.

* False negative results expected in case of low bacterial load or during early infection.

* Accuracy of sputum AFB test depends on the quality of sputum sample submitted.

* Clinical correlation is essential if suspicion is high and AFB report is negative. Culture & molecular methods like CBNAAT/TrueNAT is
recommended for confirmation.

GRAM STAIN ROUTINE
Sample PLEURAL FLUID
Leucoyte No pus cells seen.
Organism No micro-organism seen.
Remark :

* Gram stain provides only the presumptive diagnosis; Findings of Gram stain should be confirmed through culture method.

* Positive Gram stain report indicates the type of microorganism and its morphology based on the type of cells seen.

* False negative Gram stain report may be due to:

> Poor sensitivity of Microscopy method.

> Paucibacillary nature of specimen or during the presence of organisms like Treponema, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia & Rickettsia which do not

stain as they lack cell walls or are too small in size.

* — Difficult interpretation of anaerobic bacteria, Legionella, Brucella, Francisella & bacteria exhibiting the effects of antibiotics.
