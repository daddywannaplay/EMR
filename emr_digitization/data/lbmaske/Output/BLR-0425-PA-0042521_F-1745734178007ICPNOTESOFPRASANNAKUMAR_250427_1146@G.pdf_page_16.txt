Interpretation(s)
CREATININE FGFR- EPI-- Kidney disease outcomes quality initiative (EDO!) guidelines state that estimation of GFR is the best overall indices of the Kidney funetion
Tyalves @ rough measure of number of functioning nephrons Reduction Cre implies progression of underlying disease,
Ihe GER is a calculation based on serum creatinine test.
Creatinine is mainly derived from the metabolism of creatine in ols. cin and its generation is proportional to the total muscle mass. As a result, mean creatinine generation
is higher in men thart in women, in younger than in older individuals, and in blacks than in whites,
| Gicatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted into urine ot a relatively steady rate
ceunn kidney function is compromised, excretion of creatinine decrosses wit consequent increase in blood creatinine levels. With the creatinine test, a reasonable
estimate of the actual GFR can be determined,
~ This equation takes into account several factors that impact creatinine Production, including
jonK? EPI (Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) couation performed better equation especially when GFR is high(>60 ml/min per 1.73m2).. This
formula has less bias and greater accuracy which helps in early diagnosis and also reduccs|ratc of false positive diagnosis of CKD.
