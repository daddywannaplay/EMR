Iron Profile-I
lron(Fe) 58 yg/dL 50-170 Ferrozine
Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) 232 yg/dL 155 — 300 Calculated
Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) 290 yg/dL 250 - 425 Ferene
Transferrin 202.8 mg/dL 250-380 Calculated
Iron Saturation((% Transferrin Saturation) 20 %. 15-50 Calculated
Interpretation:

e Serum transferrin (and TIBC) high, serum iron low, saturation low. Usual causes of depleted iron stores include blood loss, inadequate dietary iron. RBCs in moderately severe iron
deficiency are hypochromic and microcytic. Stainable marrow iron is absent. Serum ferritin decrease is the earliest indicator of iron deficiency if inflammation is absent.

e Anemia of chronic disease: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) low to normal, serum iron low, saturation low or normal. Transferrin decreases with many inflammatory diseases. With
chronic disease there is a block in movement to and utilization of iron by marrow. This leads to low serum iron and decreased erythropoiesis. Examples include acute and chronic
infections, malignancy and renal failure.

e Sideroblastic Anemia: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) normal to low, serum iron normal to high, saturation high.

e Hemolytic Anemia: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) normal to low, serum iron high, saturation high.

 Hemochromatosis: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) slightly low, serum iron high, saturation very high.

e Protein depletion: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) may be low, serum iron normal or low (if patient also is iron deficient). This may occur as a result of malnutrition, liver disease, renal
disease.

e Liver disease: Serum transferrin variable; with acute viral hepatitis, high along with serum iron and ferritin. With chronic liver disease (eg, cirrhosis), transferrin may be low. Patients who}
have cirrhosis and portacaval shunting have saturated TIBC/transferrin as well as high ferritin.
