HEMATOLOGY
H#iba - A.P.T.T- Plasma
APTT Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time
aPTT- (Test) 32.8 Seconds 22.7-32.3
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
Interpretation:
Test done on Fully Automated Coagulometer (Clotting)
@rierpretation:
The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test measures the functionality of the intrinsic and common pathways of
the coagulation cascade.
Prolonged APTT tests may be due to:
1. Pre-analytical problems:
- Insufficient sample
- Patients with high hematocrit levels
- Heparin contamination (from IV lines)
- Clotted blood samples
2. Inherited or acquired factor deficiencies
3. Anonspecific inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant (LA)
4. A specific inhibitor. Although these are relatively rare, these are antibodies that attack a particular factor
5. DIC
6. Cirrhosis, Malabsorption
7. This APTT assay is not established to monitor Heparin Therapeutic Range. In case of monitoring patients on Heparin a
test result of 2-3.5 times of control value may likely be preferred.
8. Warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation therapy. The PTT is not used to monitor warfarin therapy, but it may be affected
by it
9. Leukemia
Oorr-contei (Normal pooled Plasma) 29.3 Seconds
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
