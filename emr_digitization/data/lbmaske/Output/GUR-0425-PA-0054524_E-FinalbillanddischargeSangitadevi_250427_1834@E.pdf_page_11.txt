INTERPRETATION:-
“GRP is an acute phase B-globulin with a molecular mass of approximately
118,000 daltons.
GRP levels in serum or plasma may rise during general,nonspecific response to
Simfectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis, cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.
Within 24 to 48 hours following acute
fise to approximately 1000 times the BCR? levels may
fermain elevated for several days before returning to normal
As elevated CRP values are always associated with pathological changes, the
CRP assay provides useful information for the diagnosis, therapy, and
Wonitoring of inflammatory conditions and associated disease.
