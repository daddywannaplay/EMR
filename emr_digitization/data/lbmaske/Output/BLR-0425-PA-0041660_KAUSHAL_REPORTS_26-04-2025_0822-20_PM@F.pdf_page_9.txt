#Blood - Prothrombin Time - Plasma
Prothrombin Time (PT)
Prothrombin time, plasma 12.0 Seconds 11-16
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
Control (MNPT) 12:2) Seconds
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
Ratio 0.98 0-100
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
@rrinr) Value 0.98 0.8-1.2
(Optical clot detection(Turbidimetry))
Interpretation:
Interpretation :
The prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) are measures of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
The INR is used only for patients on stable oral anticoagulant therapy. It makes no Significant contribution to the diagnosis
or treatment of patients whose PT is prolonged for other reasons.
Increased PT times may be due to:
Factor deficiencies( X , Il, V , I ), Coumadin (warfarin) therapy, Liver Diseases (Bile duct obstruction, Cirrhosis .
Hepatitis), Haemorhagic Disease of the newborn, DIC, Malabsorption, Fibrinolysis, Vitamin K deficiency.
Interference in PT/INR
Acohol,antibiotics, aspirin, cimetidine, thrombin Inhibitors(Increase PT) Barbiturates, oral contraceptives,
hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), and vitamin K (Decrease PT).
Correlate clinically.
