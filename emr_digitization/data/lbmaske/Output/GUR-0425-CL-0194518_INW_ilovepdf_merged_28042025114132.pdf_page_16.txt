INTERPRETATION:
in an asymptomatic patient, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of
increased AST, ALT levels. NAFLD is considered as hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome In most
type of liver disease, ALT activity is higher than that of AST; exception may be seen in Alcoholic Hepatitis,
Hepatic Cirrhosis, and Liver neoplasia. In known cases of Chronic Liver disease due to Viral Hepatitis B &
C, Alcoholic liver disease or NAFLD, Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test may be used to evaluate liver
fibrosis. In a patient with Chronic Liver disease, AFP and Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCPYPIVKA II
can be used to assess risk for development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
